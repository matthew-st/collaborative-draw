            <h1>Collaborative Drawing</h1>
            <p>
                This is a collaborative drawing application.
                We have no control over the canvas, so you may have your drawing drawn over, or there may be questionable content.
                Please be careful.
                Anyways, with that aside, we've got to complete a captcha. This is to prevent spam and is automatically completed upon pressing the button below.
            </p>
            <button id="startGameButton" onclick="reCAPTCHAsubmit">Click here when you're ready</button>
